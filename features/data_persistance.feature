Feature: Data Persistence (BSN-P08) - Whether the sensor node has collected some data, eventually the bodyhub will persist it.

	@persistance_system
	Scenario: Data Persisted Successfully (Happy Path)
		Given that persistence system is online
		When I listen to thermometer data
		And I send data to collector
		Then the data will be in persist topic
	#Given nodes are online:
	#	| Nodes         |
	#	| g4t1      	|
	#	| collector     |
	#	| param adapter |
	#	| g3t1_3     	|
	#	| data access   |
	#	| Logger     	|
	#When collector receives collect_? topic
	#Then the data will be received in logger
	#And the data will be in persist topic

	Scenario: Data Not Persisted (Sad Path)
		Given that persistence system is online
		When I listen to thermometer data
		And I send data to collector
		But a database error prevents persistence
		Then the system must log a persistence failure
		#Given nodes are online:
		#	| Nodes         |
		#	| g4t1      	|
		#	| g3t1_3     	|
		#	| data access   |
		#	| Logger     	|
		#And the sensor node has collected data
		#When collector receives collect_? topic
		#And a database error prevents persistence
		#Then the data will not be persisted
		#And the system must log a persistence failure
		#And the system may attempt a retry
